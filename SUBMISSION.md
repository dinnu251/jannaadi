## What We Built

JanNaadi ("People's Voice") is an AI-native civic intelligence platform for Greater Visakhapatnam Municipal Corporation (GVMC). Citizens submit complaints via **5 channels** — web text/voice/photo, Twilio SMS/MMS, Twilio WhatsApp (text, photo, voice note), and Twilio phone calls — in Telugu, Hindi, English, or code-mixed Hinglish. Every channel funnels into the same `persistAndProcess` pipeline. Gemini 2.5 Flash extracts structured data, pgvector clusters semantically similar complaints across 98 wards, and a ranked dashboard helps ward officers prioritise by frequency × severity × recency × demographic weight.

---

## Problem

Visakhapatnam's 2.1M citizens have no single channel to report civic issues in their own language. Complaints scatter across WhatsApp, phone calls, and walk-ins — never aggregated, never prioritised, never matched to the city's own Master Plan. Ward officers triage manually. Feature-phone users (calls/SMS) are excluded from digital feedback entirely. City investments lack real-time citizen evidence.

## Intake Channels

| Channel | Endpoint | What arrives |
|---|---|---|
| Web text | `POST /api/ingest` | Raw text |
| Web voice | `POST /api/ingest` | Audio blob → Cloud STT |
| Web photo | `POST /api/ingest` | Image + caption |
| Twilio SMS / MMS | `POST /api/twilio/sms` | Body + optional MediaUrl (photo) |
| Twilio WhatsApp text/photo/voice note | `POST /api/twilio/sms` | Same webhook, OGG_OPUS audio path |
| Twilio Phone Call | `POST /api/twilio/voice` → `POST /api/twilio/voice/recording` | WAV recording |

All channels call the same `persistAndProcess()` function — no duplicated logic, no schema differences.

**Twilio security:** Every webhook validates `X-Twilio-Signature` (HMAC-SHA1, sorted POST params, keyed by Auth Token) before any data enters the pipeline. Bad signature → 403, nothing processed. Phone numbers are stored only as `senderRef` (HMAC-SHA256 hash, 16 hex chars) — never in plaintext.

## Solution Architecture

```
Citizen
  ├── Web (text/voice/photo)  →  POST /api/ingest
  ├── SMS / MMS               →  POST /api/twilio/sms   ← HMAC-SHA1 validated
  ├── WhatsApp (txt/img/ogg)  →  POST /api/twilio/sms   ← same endpoint
  └── Phone call              →  POST /api/twilio/voice → /voice/recording
                                                          ↓
                                              persistAndProcess()
    │
    ├─ voice  → Google Cloud STT (te-IN / hi-IN / en-IN, WAV/OGG_OPUS) → transcript
    ├─ photo  → Gemini multimodal (image + caption)
    └─ text   → direct
    │

  · If ward=UNKNOWN + landmark text → Maps grounding pre-pass (groundLandmark)
    │
    ▼
text-embedding-004 → 768-dim vector
    │
    ▼
pgvector cosine similarity → cluster assignment (running-mean centroid, threshold 0.83)
    │
    ▼
Discovery Engine → plan_match (GVMC Master Plan 2041 clauses)

## Google AI & Cloud Services Used

| Service | How Used |
|---|---|
| **Gemini 2.5 Flash** | Structured extraction with JSON schema, multimodal photo analysis, Telugu/Hindi/code-mix understanding |
| **Google Maps Grounding** | Pre-pass: landmark-only ward mentions resolved to official ward names (e.g. "near RK Beach" → Ward 27) |
| **Cloud STT** | Voice transcript in te-IN, hi-IN, en-IN — WAV (phone call), OGG_OPUS (WhatsApp voice note), MP3 (web) |
| **text-embedding-004** | 768-dim multilingual semantic embeddings for clustering |
| **Discovery Engine** | RAG over GVMC Master Plan 2041 (8 plan docs ingested) |
| **Cloud Run** | Containerised Next.js + worker, auto-scale to zero |
| **Cloud SQL (PostgreSQL + pgvector)** | Submissions, clusters, audit events, rank weights, dead-letter queue |
| **Secret Manager** | DATABASE_URL, GEMINI_API_KEY, TWILIO_AUTH_TOKEN, TWILIO_WEBHOOK_BASE_URL, AUTH_SECRET, etc. — never in code |
| **Google OAuth 2.0** | Admin authentication with role-gating (@gvmc.gov.in email check) |

## Third-Party Services

| Service | How Used |
|---|---|
| **Twilio Programmable Messaging** | SMS and WhatsApp intake — text, MMS photo, WhatsApp voice note (OGG_OPUS) |
| **Twilio Voice** | Inbound call → `<Record>` TwiML → WAV download → Cloud STT → pipeline |

---

## Key Technical Decisions

**Structured Output over free-form:** `responseSchema` with closed enum lists for category and ward prevents hallucinated outputs. Retries on schema violation before dead-lettering.

**Maps grounding as a separate pre-pass:** Gemini cannot combine `googleMaps` grounding tool with `responseMimeType: application/json` (API rejects it). We run grounding only when `ward=UNKNOWN`, then feed the result into the structured extraction call.

**TypeScript-side centroid updates:** pgvector has no `vector * scalar` operator. Running-mean centroid update (`(v * n + embedding[i]) / (n + 1)`) computed in application layer.

**GEMINI_MODEL env-var pin:** Bypasses stale `app_config` DB row without a migration — critical during rapid iteration.

**Idempotent replay:** `UPDATE submissions SET status='received' WHERE is_synthetic=true AND status='failed'` at replay start makes any proxy interruption recoverable.

**Twilio signature validation before any I/O:** `lib/twilio.ts::verifyTwilio()` reconstructs the exact signed URL (using `TWILIO_WEBHOOK_BASE_URL`, not the incoming Host header — critical for tunnel/proxy setups) and does a timing-safe comparison before touching the database.

**Privacy-preserving senderRef:** Phone numbers are hashed on intake via `senderRef()` (HMAC-SHA256, 16 hex chars) and the raw number is discarded. The hash is stable per sender for deduplication but cannot be reversed.

## Validation Evidence

| Criterion | Evidence |
|---|---|
| B1 Text intake | G01–G02, G06–G07, G10–G14: processed in < 15s, extraction JSON correct |
| B1 Voice intake | G03, G04, G08, G12, G15: Cloud STT → Gemini → cluster |
| B1 Photo intake | G05, G09: Gemini multimodal extracts category + ward from image + caption |
| B2 Gajuwaka drainage | Ward 75 Pedagantyada cluster: 25 submissions, surfaces as top drainage priority |
| B3 Code-mix | G13 (Telugu-English), G14 (Hinglish): correct category and ward |
| B14 Landmark resolution | G11 "near RK Beach" → Ward 27 VIP Road, `ward_resolved_via=maps_grounding` in audit_events |
| Golden pass rate | **8/8 text items** on live Gemini + Cloud SQL (no mocks) |
| Synthetic load | 800 rows ingested, 192+ clusters formed, rank weights applied |
| Auth | Google OAuth roundtrip verified: signin → session → ADMIN role gate |
| Twilio SMS webhook | HMAC-SHA1 signature validation verified end-to-end |
| Twilio voice call | `<Record>` TwiML → WAV callback → Cloud STT → Gemini pipeline tested |
| Privacy | `senderRef()` hash in audit_events — no raw phone numbers in DB |
| Security | No secrets in tracked files; `.gitignore` covers `.env*`, `gcp-credentials.json`, `*.dump` |

## How to Run Locally (Demo Setup)

```bash
# 1. Start Cloud SQL Auth Proxy
cloud-sql-proxy jannaadi:asia-south1:jannaadi-db --port=5433

# 2. Install & run dev server
npm install
npm run dev         # Next.js on :3000

# 3. Set TWILIO_WEBHOOK_BASE_URL in .env.local to https://app.prasyn.com
#    Configure Twilio console: SMS webhook → https://app.prasyn.com/api/twilio/sms
#                               Voice webhook → https://app.prasyn.com/api/twilio/voice

# 4. Run worker replay (seed 800 submissions)
$env:REPLAY="true"; $env:GEMINI_MODEL="gemini-2.5-flash"
npx tsx --env-file=.env.local worker/ingest.ts

# 5. Run golden tests (proxy must be running, dev server on :3000)
npx tsx --env-file=.env.local scripts/golden.ts

# 6. Verify results
npx tsx --env-file=.env.local scripts/verify.ts
```

**Required `.env.local` keys:**
`DATABASE_URL`, `WEB_DATABASE_URL`, `GEMINI_API_KEY`, `GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY`, `AUTH_SECRET`, `AUTH_URL`, `GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID`, `GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET`, `PLAN_DATASTORE_ID`, `ADMIN_EMAILS`, `BASE_URL`, `TWILIO_ACCOUNT_SID`, `TWILIO_AUTH_TOKEN`, `TWILIO_WEBHOOK_BASE_URL`

---

## Deployment (Cloud Run — deploy-ready)

```bash
# 1. Store secrets in Secret Manager (one-time)
gcloud secrets create TWILIO_AUTH_TOKEN --data-file=- <<< "$TWILIO_AUTH_TOKEN"
gcloud secrets create TWILIO_WEBHOOK_BASE_URL --data-file=- <<< "https://jannaadi.run.app"
# ... similarly for DATABASE_URL, GEMINI_API_KEY, etc.

# 2. Deploy
./infra/deploy.sh
```

`infra/deploy.sh` conditionally injects Twilio secrets only when `TWILIO_ACCOUNT_SID` is set in the environment, so the same script works with or without Twilio. Cloud Run service: `jannaadi` in `asia-south1`. Dockerfile uses multi-stage Node 20 build. On Cloud Run, `TWILIO_WEBHOOK_BASE_URL` is set to the Cloud Run service URL — no tunnel needed.

## v1.2 — Citizen trust & feedback loop (added post-initial-submission)

Five additive features shipped and verified end-to-end against real Cloud SQL, GCS, and
Twilio (not mocked) — full contract in [handovers/API.md](handovers/API.md) "v1.2
additions", evidence in [handovers/backend-status.json](handovers/backend-status.json):

- **OTP verification** (`POST /api/verify/send`, `/api/verify/check`) — Twilio Verify,
  short-lived HMAC-signed token binds a phone number to a submission with consent.
- **Feedback loop** (`PATCH /api/submissions/:id/status`, admin-only) — MP staff change
  a complaint's resolution status; the citizen gets an SMS/WhatsApp update automatically.
  This is the item originally listed under "What's Next" below — now shipped.
- **Photo geofencing** — EXIF GPS on photo submissions checked against the resolved
  ward (4km radius, same threshold as Maps grounding); `null` when no EXIF GPS present
  (never penalized — most phones strip location metadata by default).
- **Citizen trust scoring** — a hidden, phone-keyed reputation signal that gates which
  submissions count toward a cluster's *ranking* frequency, without ever appearing in
  any API response or changing the displayed `submission_count` (transparency preserved;
  the frontend's 4-component score-breakdown panel shape is unchanged).
- **AI dedup** — a near-identical resubmission from the same phone/account within 24h
  is linked via `duplicate_of` instead of inflating a cluster; a genuinely different
  citizen reporting the same real-world issue still clusters normally (verified as an
  explicit control case, not just the happy path).

All five are scoped to explicit, phone-opted-in submitters — the existing Twilio-inbound
privacy design (non-reversible `senderRef` hash, no raw phone stored) is untouched.

## What's Next

- Twilio WhatsApp WABA approval (production sender — sandbox works for demo)
- Ward councillor mobile app (push notifications on new clusters)
- Expand to all 13 ULBs in Visakhapatnam district
- Open API for third-party integrations (e.g., municipal ERP systems)
- Frontend UI for the v1.2 features above (currently backend-only — no phone/OTP entry
  point on the citizen submit form yet, no status-change control on the MP dashboard)
